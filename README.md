Hi, I'm @we-re-wolf

I'm interested in Fintech, Quantitative Finance, and Software Development.

I'm currently learning Advanced Python for Quantitative Finance and exploring Machine Learning applications in Finance.

I'm looking to collaborate on Fintech projects and Quantitative Trading Simulations. I welcome contributions to my GitHub repositories, where I regularly upload projects related to Quant Finance and Software Development.

Let's build something impactful together!
